# It Makes Bubbles (IMB)

Under development

The goal is to change the way we interact with our browser. The first step is to change the use of histories. We are developing a tool to provide a different way of accessing and using the information in history data. The major difference is not to have a mere list, but classified webpages, grouped together by common attributes and presentation as such. We are optimizing the whole process and providing more features.
